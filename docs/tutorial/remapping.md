# Remapping a Connections File

## Prerequisites

To be able to remap the connections, we need of course the original remapping file. This original yaml file needs to be downloaded from the new target cluster after the migration pipeline has completed and the backup has been restored. This this will need to be placed in the /projects/myfirstproject/input/connections_yaml folder.
